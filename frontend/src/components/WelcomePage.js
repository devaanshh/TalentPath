          TalentPath is a smart project suggestion platform where the user inputs their skills (e.g., Python, React, ML, Figma), chooses interests (e.g., Healthcare, Climate, Cybersecurity), shows availability (Full-time or Part-time), and chooses a preferred project type (Research, Technical, or Creative). The system then suggests to them suitable projects based on their profile and interests.
